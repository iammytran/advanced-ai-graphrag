        "question": "How does XGBoost improve over standard Gradient Boosting?",
        "expected_answer": "XGBoost improves over standard Gradient Boosting by introducing regularization (L1 and L2) to prevent overfitting, using a more efficient tree-pruning algorithm, and supporting parallel processing for faster training.",

        "question": "Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.",
        "expected_answer": "L1 regularization (Lasso) adds the absolute value of coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function, which can lead to sparse models (feature selection). L2 regularization (Ridge) adds the squared magnitude of coefficients, which shrinks coefficients but keeps them non-zero.",
        "reference_contexts": [
            "L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients."

        "reference_contexts": [
            "SMOTE works by selecting examples that are close in the feature space, drawing a line between the examples in the feature space and drawing a new sample at a point along that line."
